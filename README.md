# Greenside
Web Application that I am making in React and Express to visualise and analyse my golf rounds amongst other things.

My watchOS/iOS apps save data to my FireStore and this web app pulls that data and will visualise every shot that I have taken on various golf rounds.
Aim of the project is to challenge myself, learn more and increase my skillset/knowledge and improve at my favourite hobby, Golf.
